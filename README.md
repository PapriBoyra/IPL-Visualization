# 🏏 IPL Visualization Project (2008–2017)

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of IPL (Indian Premier League) data from 2008 to 2017 using interactive Tableau dashboards. It explores match results, player performances, and team statistics to uncover key insights from a decade of IPL history.

## 📁 Dataset

The project uses two datasets 

- `matches.csv`: Match-level information (season, teams, winner, toss results, etc.)
- `deliveries.csv`: Ball-by-ball deliveries data (batsman, bowler, runs, dismissals, etc.)

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Tableau Public** – For building and sharing interactive dashboards
- **Microsoft PowerPoint** – For summarizing insights in a presentation

## 📊 Dashboards

### 1. Match Statistics
